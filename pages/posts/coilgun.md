# Coilgun MK.IV

<p>One of my favorite project that I ever made.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when I was still in middle school, I started watching ElectroBoom and one of his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdZo_keUoEs">sparked my curiosity</a>.
The possibility to create a "gun" that runs purely on electricity trilled me. So I started designing one on my own, with zero experience in electronics and programming.</p>
