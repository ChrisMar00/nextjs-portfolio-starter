<p>This is the first coilgun I've ever made, the Coilgun MK.I. Me and my friend [Alex](https://github.com/AlessandroBonomo28) used a Raspberry Pi 3 to time the firing of the relays to discharge the capacitors into the BAD wound coils. We've been using a small metal pin as projectile, weighting ~2g. This prototype didn't work at all, but surely was a good test bench to learn the basics of electronics and programming.</p>

### Features
- Raspberry Pi 3 as the MCU
- 3 Stages, each one with 4x 25V@4700Î¼F capacitors in parallel
- Relays with manual firing timing
- SMPS to charge up the capacitor bank
- Efficency unkown
